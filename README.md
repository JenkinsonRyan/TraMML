# bert-multitask-learning [WIP]
Ryan Jenkinson, MSc Project (2019) - An investigation into multitask learning and meta learning for NLU problems, with specific focus on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. This project is in industry collaboration with Streetbees.

This project will investigate a multitask learning approach to aspect based sentiment analysis, and investigate whether auxilliary tasks improve the performance of our base language model by supporting the primary task.
